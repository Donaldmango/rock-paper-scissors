How it works:
The game asks the user to input their choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
It generates a random choice for the computer.
It compares both choices and determines the winner based on the standard rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors:
Rock beats Scissors.
Scissors beats Paper.
Paper beats Rock.
The winner is displayed.
To play, just copy this code into a Python file and run it in your terminal or IDE.

Yes! There are a few improvements we can make to enhance the game and make it more interactive and user-friendly:

Replay Option: Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the game.
Display Score: Track the score for the player and the computer over multiple rounds.
Enhanced Input Handling: Handle edge cases and improve input validation for invalid responses.
Clearer Instructions: Add a helpful introduction with game instructions.
Game Ending Option: Let the player choose when to stop playing.
Here's an updated version that includes these improvements:
